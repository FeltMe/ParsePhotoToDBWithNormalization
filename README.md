# ParsePhotoToDBWithNormalization
First tryes
The task of the program was to add paths to a certain type of file from the whole computer to the database, 
but simply transferring the path would not be very effective, because the paths are repeated quite often. 
Therefore, it was decided to create a separate table where there would be some separate paths and their ID. 
It is difficult to call this normalization, because the goal was to save memory in the database.
